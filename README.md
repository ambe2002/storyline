some little project about code

## Idea
This is a side project about learning code, we use Java as the program language, the target is to create a website about hot spots, big events, or some people we need to notice.

## Main structure
* We use Spring boot as the main bone behind the project. It's a java based frame work for building a website, or web app is more precisely. The data will store in a database from MySQL. The front page is built from freemarker. You can download this project, and build with Eclipse+Maven, then there will be an jar file. Then run this jar file with  

`java -jar jar_file_name.jar`

* Or you can use this quick demo, we deployed this project to a vps.
